Hey there! My name is Qihua "Kimmy" Ye, and I am an Immunology Ph.D. Candidate in [Evans Lab](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/pulmonary/research/labs/introduction) at the University of Colorado - Anschutz Medical Campus. I have a long-standing interest in lung biology and mucosal immunology. My previous research encompassed mycobacteriology and cystic fibrosis, type II inflammation, airway epithelial biology, and cellular senescence. Currently, I am studying airspace macrophage biology and immune response in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
